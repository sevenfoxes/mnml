# MNML 16

> branches are locked to specific node environments on an as needed basis with the default being `stable` that is, the latest node, which may break unexpectedly

My preferred personal configuration for writing react.

> NOTE: stable currently not stable :) if you'd like to make a pr with a branch of 17 feel free! Till then, I'm totally fine on 16 right now
